// WISDOM:
//
// A simulation that would put physics on another thread should likely do so in a different app
// domain with communication via .NET remoting to make 100% sure that no sharing is happening.
//
// NOTE: for simulation types, value semantics are preferred over open semantics as it eases
// serialization and other forms of automation. However, perhaps there is a way to get both...

// TODO: go through Prime and label / attribute all its types as was done here.
