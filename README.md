FP Works Repository
===================

This repository hosts several projects, including -


- ![Alt text](Nu/Promotional/Nu Icon.png?raw=true "Nu Game Engine"), the **Nu Game Engine**, 
- the programming language **Aml**,
- the small but potentially useful F# code library **Prime**, and
- the game **OmniBlade** that I just barely started on.

The best way to get started is to pull down the repository with a git client, and to take a look at the following documents -

The current documentation for the **Nu Game Engine** is found here - https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks/blob/master/Nu/Documentation/Nu%20Game%20Engine.pdf?raw=true

The current documentation for the **Aml** programming language is found here - https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks/tree/master/Aml/Documentation

If you're looking at Aml, run the **AmlRepl project** from Visual Studio and follow its instructions (especially in studying the StdLib Aml code to get a real feel for the language).

Finally, please check out the license for this repository below!

Thanks all for checking out my work so far!

Sponsors
========

The **Nu Game Engine** is looking for sponsors! If you're interested in sponsoring development for what I hope will become **the world's first mainstream functional game engine**, please contact me at bryanedds@gmail.com . Otherwise, I'll just have to work on it in my spare time, which can be erratic :S

**OmniBlade** is also looking for sponsors!
