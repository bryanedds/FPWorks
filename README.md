The best way to get started is to pull down the repository with a git client, and to take a look at the following documents, and if studying Aml, to run the AmlRepl project.

The current documentation for the Nu Game Engine is found here - https://github.com/bryanedds/OmniBlade/blob/master/Nu/Documentation/Nu%20Game%20Engine.pdf?raw=true

The current documentation for the Aml programming language is found here - https://github.com/bryanedds/OmniBlade/tree/master/Aml/Documentation
