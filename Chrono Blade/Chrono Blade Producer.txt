Looking for a producer for Chrono Blade [PAID]

Hello, I'm the developer of Chrono Blade, the upcoming cross-platform RPG for mobile. I'm looking for someone to take the producer role to get the game ready for Kickstarter. As you can see from the demo here - - the game is nearly feature complete, but still needs original art and sounds. As a Producer, I need you to take the following roles -

1) Recruit and manage a suitable artist for getting enough original art into Chrono Blade so that it can have a successful Kickstarter.
2) Recruit and manage a suitable sound engineer for getting enough original music and sounds into Chrono Blade for the same reason.
3) Set up and run the Kickstarter campaign to a successful conslusion, approximately 3 months from when you have been hired.

There are a few specific challenges you will have to tackle -

1) In terms of recruiting, there won't be a budget for the artist or sound engineer until the Kickstarter is successful. So you must help them to understand that they cannot be compensated until the KS is successful, but when it is, they will be compensated retroactively and going forward. Another option you have is to raise funds for the pre-Kickstarter work from other sources (I leave this up to you).
2) Running the Kickstarter campaign is itself a part-time job. You will have to be available nearly every day to involve the donating community and add value to the Kickstarter campaign.
3) Game development costs are absolute; we must have a reasonable minimum funding goal in order to consider a Kickstarter campaign success a business success.

As a bonus, if you run a successful Kickstarter campaign, I will award you immediately with a percentage of the campaign funds (the percentage is to be discussed).

If you have the people skill, individual will, and schedule ability (VERY important!), please contact me at bryanedds@gmail.com to get started!
